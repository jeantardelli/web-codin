The Facebook Like and Share Buttons can be clicked to create a connection between a piece of content
and the person clicking the button. A count of all the likes can be displayed. To integrate the Facebook
Like and Share Buttons, first create a Facebook App at:

	https://developers.facebook.com/apps

Then go to:

	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button

to configure the buttons and get the JavaScript code. Similarly, after you have registered an App, you
can implement Facebook Comments at:

	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/

A list of possible Facebook plugins can be found at:
