<!-- A sessionStorage variable is like a localStorage variable, except that it is deleted
	when the visitor closes the browser window or tab.

	Here ‘test’ is an arbitrarily defined property, and can only be assigned a string value.
	When the page first loads, localStorage.test and sessionStorage.test are undefined. As
	the user refreshes the page, the browser alerts the messages. -->
