If you wish to send an SMS from a computer, you should first sign up for an account at an SMS gateway
such as Clickatell, ViaNett, Nexmo etc. While it is possible to send an SMS through Javascript alone via
HTTP GET (or POST), it is possibly a better idea to send it through PHP cURL (Chapter 16) so that your
account credentials are hidden from the user at the client end. The official websites of the gateways
contain information about how to send an SMS invarious ways.
