Local Storage
=============

Like a cookie, a localStorage variable remains on the visitorâ€™s computer after the browser window is closed. Unlike a cookie,
it is not sent to the server and does not expire. It can only be accessed by the web page that stores it. Only used when asked
for, it can store large amounts of data without affecting the performance. For information about how to store files and images
in localStorage, refer to: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/saving-images-and-files-in-localstorage/
