<!-- You can tell if a ‘bar’ is visible with its '.visible' property.
	alert(...) halts the script execution until the OK button on the popped-up window is clicked.
	confirm(...) halts the script execution until the OK or Cancel button on the popped-up window is clicked.
	prompt(...) halts the script execution, prompts for a string, until the OK or Cancel button on the popped-up window is clicked.

	You can open a new window with open(...).
	openDialog(...) is an extension to open(...) in the sense that the former allows extra data to be passed to the new window in the form of 'w.arguments[]'.
	The features include ‘left’, ‘top’, ‘height’, ‘width’, ‘screenX’,‘screenY’, ‘centerscreen’, ‘outerHeight’, ‘outerWidth’, ‘innerHeight’, ‘innerWidth’,
	‘menubar’, ‘toolbar’,‘location’, ‘personalbar’, ‘status’, ‘dependent’, ‘dialog’, ‘minimizable’, ‘fullscreen’, ‘resizable’, ‘scrollbars’,‘titlebar’,
	‘alwaysRaised’, ‘alwaysLowered’ and ‘close’. If there are only two states for a feature, you can turn it on by specifying ‘feature’, ‘feature=yes’ or ‘feature=1’. -->
