IndexedDB
=========

An IndexedDB is organized into databases. Adatabase contains object stores (comparable to tablesin SQL),
which in turn contain objects or other types of data. An object store can be structured in 4 way

keyPath autoIncrement
(none)      false     : (1)
‘key’       false     : (2)
(none)      true      : (3)
‘key’       true      : (4)

(1): The object store can hold any value. You must supply a separate key argument whenever you want to add a new value.
(2): The object store can only hold objects. The object must have a property with the same name as the key path.
(3): The object store can hold any value. The key is generated for you automatically, or you can supply a separate key argument if you want to use aspecific key.
(4): The object store can only hold objects. Usually a key is generated and the value of the generated key is stored in the object in a property with the same
     name as the key path. If such a property already exists, the value of that property is used as the key rather than generating a new key.

The operations for IndexedDB are mostly asynchronous, which means that before a function returns, other code may continue.
