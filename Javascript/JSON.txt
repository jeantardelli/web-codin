JSON
====

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is a syntax for serializing objects and arrays. A JSON string can
be easily stored or transmitted. Although it uses Javascript syntax for storing information, it is language
independent and may be used in various programming languages.

Methods:
    JSON.parse(s1[, f(s2,a)]) converts the string s1 to a JSON object. f(s2,a) transforms the returned value,
    using the key s2 and the value a.

    JSON.stringify(o [,f(s1,a) [, s2]]) or JSON.stringify(o [,arr [, s2]]) converts a JSONobject o to a string.
    f(s1,a) transforms the returned value, using the key s1 and the value a. arr specifies the set of properties
    included. s2 is a string of space that causes the resulting string to be pretty-printed.
