<!-- We have seen how to capture some mouse, keyboard and scrolling events. We did this by attaching
	some Javascript code to the ‘onX’ event attributes in an element. There are two other ways by which
	an event can be defined.

	(1) You can attach a function directly to the 'onX' property of an element -->
<html>
<body>
	<button>Click</button>
	<script>
		window.onload = alert(1);
		document.onkeyup = function(e) { alert(e.keyCode); };
		document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0].onclick = function(e) { alert(e.button); };
	</script>
</body>
</html>
