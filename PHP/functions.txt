A function is a piece of code which may be called using its name. It can take in arguments and return a value.
Unlike variable names, function names are case-insensitive. Structuring a code with functions makes it readable and maintainable.

Default values, when passed to arguments after =, must appear at the end of the arguments list.

A string may be used as a function name.

A function needs not exist in a place before where it is called. However, if it is defined within an if-block or within a function,
it needs to be 'executed' before it becomes visible globally.

Variables inside a function are not visible outside the function. For global variables outside a function to be visible inside a
function, they must first be referenced with global.
