To use the code from another file, include the file. The scope applied is the scope at the point of 
inclusion. The indluded file must start with <?php and end with ?>, otherwise it will be treated as
HTML code. 1 is returned if the inclusion is successful, otherwise false is returned. An arbitrary
value may be returned in the middle of the included file.

An alternative is to use require. The only difference is that upon failure, include merely generates
a warning, whereas require results in an error and halts the script. To make sure files that have been
included will not be included again, use include_once or require_once instead.

Try declare a tick diretive for a function to be called automatically after every one or more (tickable)
statements.

Another directive to declare would be the encoding directive.

<?php
declare(encoding='ISO-8859-1');
// code here
?>
