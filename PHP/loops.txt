There are several ways to run a block of statements repeatedly:

	while(cycle condition){statements;}
	do {statements;} while(cycle condition);
	for (pre-loop statements;
	     cycle condition;
	     cycle statements;){statements;}
	foreach($array as $value){statements;}
	foreach($array as $key => $value){statements;}

Each of these code segments calculates the sum of 0 to 9.

	$a=0; $sum=0;
	while($a<10) $sum += $a++;

	$a=0; $sum=0;
	do {$sum += $a++;} while ($a<10);

	for($a=0, $sum=0; $a<10; $a++) $sum+=$a;

foreach is used to loop through the values of anarray or class object.

break [i]; ends the loop instantly. continue [i]; ends the current iteration of loop and starts the next iteration by
evaluating the cycle condition. i is an optional integer that tells how many levels of loops to end. If omitted, it will be regarded as 1,
ie. the current level.

goto causes the exectution to jump to a point specified by a label, which is a name followed by a ‘:’. It can also be used to run the same
statements repeatedly, or get out of multi-level loops.
