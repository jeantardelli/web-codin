An object can be serialized to a string (and stored into a file). As serialize($o) is called, PHP first runs the
magic function __sleep(), which returns an array of the variable names to be serialized. To restore a serialized
string to an object, use unserialize($s). __wakeup() will be called after an object has been unserialized.

__set_state($arr) is called when var_export($o) is called on an object. The latter is a function similar to var_dump(),
which outputs the content of avariable, except that the output is PHP code.
