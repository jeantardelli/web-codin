A class often extends another class and inherits its members. The child may override a property or method from the parent class
(using the same arguments and visibility signature). Methods declared final must not be overridden, whereas final classes must not
be inherited. Properties and method declared public are accessibl eeverywhere.

If they are declared as private, they are accessible only within the class and are not inheritable. If they are declared protected,
they are only accessible within the class, any inheriting classes, and any inherited classes. If undeclared, a method in a class is
public by default. Properties, when being initialized, must take constant values, instead of other variables or expressions.

The properties of an object can be looped throug hwith foreach.

Two objects are equal (==) if they belong to the same class, and their properties have equal values. Two objects are identical (===)
only if they refer to the same instance. The instanceof operator tests if an object belongs to a class.

If two objects are of the same class, they will have access to each otherâ€™s private and protected members.
