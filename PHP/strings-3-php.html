<!-- Arrays and object properties can also be expanded in double-quoted strings. Enclose the identifier with {}
	so that the parser will not regard any irrelevant characters as part of the identifier. Functions, static class
	variables, and class constants inside {} will cause the return value to be interpreted as variable names for expansion.

	Ommitting the curly bracktes will cause error because $fruits is undefined -->
