Magic functions are functions that are triggered automatically when special events happen. They can be defined in any class.

__construct([$m1,$m2...]) is called when an object is created. A child class can override the parent’s ‘constructor’ with a
different arguments signature. $m1, $m2 can be any content type (mixed). __destruct() is called when there are no more references
to an object. __clone() is called when an object is cloned.
