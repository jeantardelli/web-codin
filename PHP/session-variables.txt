Accessible to all web pages, a session variable can be set or accessed with $_SESSION. It lasts until the
user has closed the browser. One must first start up a session before information can be stored in a session.
session_start() has to be used before the <html> tag.

session_destroy() closes a session, deleting all session variables.
