A namespace is used to prevent the name collisions of constants, functions, classes and interfaces.
Its declaration must precede all other statements in a file, including any HTML code. The only statement
that can precede it is the declare() statement used for the encoding directive.

If a namespaced function or constant does not exist, PHP will automatically fall back to global functions or
constants. On the other hand, class names always resolve to the current namespace.

We can use an alias for a class name, an interface name or a namespace.
