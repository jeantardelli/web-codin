PHP runs on the server. Particularly, it can process forms, files and databases over the internet.

To use PHP, you must first rent a server from a webhost such as iPage, or set up your own server (Chapter 13).
There are all-in-one packages that allow PHP to be run on a local computer, such as XAMPP and WampServer.
These distributions contain Apache, PHP, MySQL and other applications.

When a PHP file is requested from the server, the server first executes blocks
of PHP code within the file. A ‘normal HTML file’ is then returned to the client’s browser.
As such, there is no way for a casual visitor to read the PHP code. These blocks of code are
contained by the symbols <?php … ?>.
